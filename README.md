## Usage Guide

### Data Stream Registration

```javascript
// Example stream registration
const streamToken = await StreamToken.deployed();
await streamToken.registerStream(
    deviceId,
    metadata,
    updateFrequency,
    dataSchema,
    basePrice
);
```

### Data Quality Scoring

```solidity
qualityScore = (accuracy * 0.4) + (reliability * 0.3) + (uptime * 0.3)
where:
- accuracy: Data accuracy score (0-100)
- reliability: Stream reliability score (0-100)
- uptime: Device uptime percentage
```

## IoT Protocol Integration

### Supported Protocols
- MQTT
- CoAP
- HTTP/REST
- WebSocket
- LoRaWAN

### Protocol Adapter Example
```javascript
// MQTT adapter implementation
class MQTTAdapter extends BaseAdapter {
    async connectDevice(deviceId, credentials) {
        const client = await mqtt.connect(brokerUrl, credentials);
        return new DataStream(client, deviceId);
    }
}
```
